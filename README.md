# Architecture

## Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Express is a Node.js web application framework it is utilized on the server-side to help handle HTTP requests to serve HTML, JSON, and other content to the client. JavaScript is used for server side scripting adding behavior and interactivity to webpages. SPAs load a single HTML page and dynamically updates that based on how the user interacts with the webpage.

## Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
We utilized NoSQL MongoDB database for the backend because it provided many things needed to have scalability such as, schema flexibility. It is also very developer friendly, meaning the queries and operations are very intuitive and easy to understand.

# Functionality

## How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces? Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
JSON is different from Javascript. JavaScript is a programming language that provides functionality while JSON is a data interchange format utilizing a text-based format to represent structured data. JSON ties together frontend and backend development by being the most common data format for data exchange between both ends. It also is used for serialization and parsing between both ends. During the full stack development process there was a time where I refactored code to make it easier to read, this ended up putting some of the code in a different file so the main file was easier to understand and read. Utilizing reusable UI components is beneficial because they promote code maintainability and reusability. Utilizing the same buttons for one part of your web application in another webpage helps keep your code clean.

# Testing

## Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
The methods for various types of API testing of endpoints include the HTTP medthods of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. These methods help ensure the API is configured correctly and running. API endpoints are URLs which define the locations of where API requests can be made. Security ensures that only authorized users can access the application.

# Reflection

## How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
This course helped me increase my knowledge in full stack applications and restful APIs. It helped me further by helping me hopefully gain more knowledge to find a job in this job market. I've learned more about how to create methods, endpoints, and implement security in full stack applications. I've also learned how to review code to ensure it looks clean and operates effectively.
